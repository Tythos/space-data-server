# space data server

Space Data Server is an open-source software package that helps integrators get started including data standards from [SpaceDataStandards.org](https://spacedatastandards.org) into their workflows. ([Demo](http://208.87.130.67:3000/#/api), under heavy development)
The SDS acts as a "waypoint" for ingestion / data services, allowing integrators to ingest data from any source (ex., Celestrak OMM).
